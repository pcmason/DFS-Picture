# DFS-Picture
A project that goes through a 2 dimensional array of 0's and 1's and changes any 1 it sees into a 2 only for as many 1's touch each other. Then on the next group of 1's will become 3's and so on.


picOutput1.txt shows a screenshot of the 2D array before the code is run and DFSIMAGE.txt shows the results after.

You can run the program on your own inserting a 2D array no smaller than 5X5 and no larger than 20X20.
